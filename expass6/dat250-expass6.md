- No technical problems during the completion of the tutorials from [Spring](https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/) and [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). Everything super well described and explained.


- <u>Links to my projects code for experiments:</u>

  	• Experiment 1: Modell-View-Controller Web Applications [mvc](https://github.com/wpa001/dat250/tree/master/expass6/serving-web-content).
  	
  	• Experiment 2: Single-page Web Applications [tutorial](https://github.com/wpa001/dat250/tree/master/expass6/intro-to-react).

- No further pending issues. All was done very smoothly and fast :)
