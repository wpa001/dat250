##Software Technology Experiment 1##

• I installed everything from the list of requirted tools for this course, besides eclipse and java jdk. As i already had another course where those softwares were required. All other programs had no problems when installed and set up.

• To validate the programs and softwares, i needed to add directory to those programs into my PATH, so those could be used in command line (cmd). 

• In following the tutorial and setting up heroku platform, i had no problems or "bumps" in the road. Only thing i had few back and fourth thoughts about, was the case where i had to add my Credit card information. In order to make addons possible to use on heroku, i had to add "verify my account". I didnt know it was a requirement, so i tried to end the tutorial withiut verifying and i encoutered that i could see logs in web browser or database in tarminal. Other than that, it went pretty smoothly anfd i had a bunch of fun doing the experiment.

• All is up and running with the assignment and even the whole website which i was working with on the tutorial is up and [running!] (https://wpa001-assignment1.herokuapp.com/)
