• No technical problems during the completion of the several basic tutorials on [Spring](start.spring.io)

• [Link](https://github.com/wpa001/dat250/tree/master/expass4 "expass4 code") to my expass4 code in **Experiment 2: REST API for TODO-items**

• No further pending issues and all was done with even more things than required for exp2. Like searching up a specific todo by its id and many error catchings that may occure :)
